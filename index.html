    <section id="about">
      <p>Experienced in building user-centered digital solutions from ideation to deployment, I transform concepts into production-ready systems‚Äîfrom neurons to pixels, Figma to the Cloud. I accelerate development cycles through rapid prototyping with Lean UX, Agile, and DevOps methodologies, leading successful projects that ensure high-quality, secure, and accessible experiences. With my unique background in physics, design, and computer science, I bring a blend of technical expertise and creative problem-solving to the table, backed by certifications in UX (Microsoft), React.js (META), and Cybersecurity (Google, IBM & InfoSec). Constantly exploring cutting-edge technologies and specializing at the intersection of UX and Front-end development, I'm equally comfortable with the command line, containers, and various cloud platforms.</p>
